# How to Run the Code

To run the code, simply open the `Extension1_notebook.ipynb` file on Google Colab. Once opened, ensure that you select the GPU as your hardware accelerator. You can then execute all the cells in sequence.

The last cell contains scripts to train all the tested models. To choose a specific script to run, you can simply comment out the others and uncomment the one you're interested in using.
