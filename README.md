# How to Run the Code

## Extension 1

To run the code, simply open the `Extension1_notebook.ipynb` file on Google Colab. Once opened, ensure that you select the GPU as your hardware accelerator. You can then execute all the cells in sequence.

The last cell contains scripts to train all the tested models. To choose a specific script to run, you can simply comment out the others and uncomment the one you're interested in using.

## Extension 2

For the second extension, there are two notebooks available:

1. **TweetSumm Dataset Creation**: `Tweetsumm_preprocessing.ipynb`
2. **Training with SICK**: `SICK_on_Tweetsumm.ipynb`

To use these notebooks, simply upload them to Google Colab, select the GPU as your hardware accelerator, and execute all the cells in each notebook.

The outcomes from the first notebook (`Tweetsumm_preprocessing.ipynb`) are already available in the Git repository, eliminating the need to recreate the dataset.
